I am a Computer Science Ph.D. student at Washington University in St. Louis. My Ph.D. advisor is [Dr. I-Ting Angelina Lee](https://www.cse.wustl.edu/~angelee/home_page/).
Prior to joining Washington University in St. Louis I worked as a software engineer at [Ciholas, Inc.](https://www.ciholas.com), where I primarily worked on designing and implementing
network protocols and schedulers for managing ultra-wideband (UWB) radio networks. I also did some work on real-time location services (rtls) and firmware for use with the UWB networks.
Prior to starting at Ciholas, Inc., I received my B.S. in Computer Science from the University of Evansville in 2013 and briefly taught English in Chungju-si, Chungcheongbok-do, South Korea.

My research interests are in providing language abstractions, performance and correctness tools, and runtime support for parallel programming. I aim to provide parallel runtimes that are both provably
and practically efficient at scheduling parallel code written using intuitive language abstractions. In the cases that the language abstractions allow for the introduction of programming mistakes, I
aim to develop tools to help provide the user with confidence that their code is correct.
